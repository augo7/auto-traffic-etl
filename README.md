üö¶ Traffic Data Pipeline: Automated ETL with Python & BigQuery
This project delivers a scalable, automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for collecting, processing, and analyzing real-time urban traffic data. Using public mobility APIs, Python‚Äôs data stack, and Google BigQuery, the pipeline is designed to reflect real-world data engineering practices and support time-based traffic analytics at city scale.

By incorporating API integration, automated scheduling, and cloud warehousing, this project enables streamlined data ingestion and intelligent traffic insights across geographic and temporal dimensions.

üîç Project Highlights

API Integration & Data Extraction:
Connects to open mobility APIs (e.g. Austin Open Data, NYC Open Data) to pull traffic data in structured formats (JSON/CSV), with flexibility for expanding to additional urban regions.

Data Transformation:
Cleans and organizes traffic data using Python and Pandas‚Äîhandling missing timestamps, normalizing time zones, and engineering features like time of day, weekday, and geographic zones.

Cloud Data Warehousing:
Loads the transformed datasets into Google BigQuery, enabling fast, scalable querying for trend analysis and congestion insights.

Scheduling & Automation:
Implements a scheduled update system using GitHub Actions (or cron), automating daily or weekly pulls and refreshes to keep BigQuery tables up-to-date without manual intervention.

Analytical Insight:
Supports complex SQL queries to identify peak congestion windows, compare traffic volumes across neighborhoods, and track changes in urban flow over time using window functions and ranking.
